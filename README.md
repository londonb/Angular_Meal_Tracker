## Description

A very basic app that will allow the user to keep track of their meals by inputting the calories for the meal (along with a name and description)

## Set-Up Instructions

To run the app on your computer, you will have to clone the repo from https://github.com/londonb/Angular_Meal_Tracker

#### NPM/Bower Install
This repo includes a "bower.json" file and a "package.json" file that will allow you to run the app with the correct files to have the app run.

To download these files you need to enter on the command line in the directory where you cloned this repo:
* npm install
* bower install

#### Run the Local Server
On the command line (while still in the directory where the repo is), run these commands:
* gulp build
* gulp Server

A page will automatically open (located at http:localhost:3000/) in your preferred browser.

Note: This app has only been tested on a Chrome browser and results may vary on different browsers.
